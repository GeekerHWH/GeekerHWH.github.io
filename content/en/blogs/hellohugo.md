## Hello Hugo
This is my first time to use hugo framework and my first time to write my blogs.

As you may see, there are also Chinese blogs available. Due to my busy daily work, I can only update my English blogs first, Chinese is the second.

I'm a person that like to try different things, I enjoy investing, coding and learning
new stuffs that are attractive. So the purpose of creating this blog site is mainly to
share the technical knowledge and my opinion on some stuffs in the financial realm.

I know, a technical person talking about economy and finance sounds weird or untrustworthy or
not very reliable. Well, I think that's the beauty of market, everyone has the right to
present their perspective on something. Whether you like or not, I think some of 
my opinion, at least in the tech realm, is valuable, hope you enjoy.

Of course, most of the content will be tech-related, after all I'm a tech guy.
Embrace open source, embrace Linux, embrace my hobby.

Glad to see you guys and hope you enjoy the world I created : )
